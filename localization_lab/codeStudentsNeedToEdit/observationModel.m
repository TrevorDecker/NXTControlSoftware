%pM stands for probability map, map is the input map showing where obstacles
%and tennis balls are located, measurement is the reading from the sensor
%pipeline in the simulator case this is a n by 2 matrix where the first
%column is the bearing to an observed tennis ball and the second column is
%the range to a observed tennis ball. 
function [pM] = observationModel(map,measurment,pM)
%TODO given the measurement, map, and current probability map update the
%probability map
